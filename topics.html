			<div class="aboutInfo">
				<h3 class="headerMargin purple">Physical and mental changes</h3>
				<p>We will discuss both the physical and mental changes that accompany puberty, including topics like breast development, hair growth, changes in body odor, and changes in mood.</p>
				<h3 class="headerMargin purple">Female Anatomy</h3>
				<p>We cover the female anatomy, discussing both the structures that make up the female reproductive system, along with the function of each structure.</p>
				<h3 class="headerMargin purple">The menstrual cycle</h3>
				<p>We cover menstruation in-depth, and we focus on what is happening in the body during the menstrual cycle rather than focusing on reproduction. We&rsquo;ve found that this helps girls develop a better sense of why their bodies are changing, as opposed to framing their experiences in terms of reproduction and future pregnancy. This leads to a deeper understanding of their bodies and improved confidence.</p>
				<p class="paragraphMargin">We will discuss the role of female sex hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); the ovarian cycle, including the follicular phase, follicle development and ovulation, and the luteal phase; the uterine cycle, including the secretory phase, the proliferative phase, and menstruation; and cervical fluid development and changes.</p>
				<h3 class="headerMargin purple">Menstrual health &amp; hygiene</h3>
				<p>We will discuss different menstrual products&mdash;including pads, panty-liners, tampons, cloth pads, and menstrual cups&mdash;and will allow the girls to handle these products to get a better sense of how they are used.</p>
				<p class="paragraphMargin">We will also do an activity that will help the girls learn how to identify a vaginal infection or other abnormality that requires the help of a parent or doctor.</p>
				<h3 class="headerMargin purple">Q &amp; A</h3>
				<p>Before wrapping up the course, we will have a question-and-answer session that will allow the girls to clarify any questions they may have. Alternatively, we encourage girls to write down and anonymously submit any questions they are not comfortable asking in front of others.</p>
				<h3 class="headerMargin purple">Period Starter Kit</h3>
				<p>Each girl will go home with a period starter kit, which will include a reusable cloth pad, organic tampons, and organic panty-liners. Additionally, it will include a carrying pouch and an information booklet. The items in the starter kit retail for about $25.</p>
